The auditorium features a row of dark wooden seats arranged in a tiered fashion, with each row slightly elevated above the one in front of it. The seats are uniformly spaced and aligned in a straight line, creating a symmetrical and orderly appearance. The back of the auditorium is adorned with a series of evenly spaced, small, rectangular cutouts along the top edge, adding a decorative element to the otherwise simple design.
