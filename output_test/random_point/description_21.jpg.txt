The floor is composed of light-colored wooden planks arranged in a herringbone pattern. The planks are of varying widths, creating a visually appealing zigzag effect. The wood has a smooth finish, enhancing the natural grain and texture of the planks. The herringbone pattern is consistent throughout the visible area, with the planks running parallel to each other.
