The floor is composed of light-colored wooden planks arranged in a herringbone pattern. The planks are of varying widths, creating a visually appealing zigzag effect. The wood has a smooth finish, with subtle grain patterns visible throughout. The planks are laid out in a consistent, interlocking manner, forming a continuous and cohesive surface.
